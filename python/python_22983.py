# Python stemmer issue: wrong stem
In computational linguistics, a stem is the part of the word that never changes even when morphologically inflected, whilst a lemma is the base form of the word. For example, given the word "produced", its lemma (linguistics) is "produce", however the stem is "produc": this is because there are words such as production.

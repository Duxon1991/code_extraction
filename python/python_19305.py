# Why does NLTK WordNet fail finding simple words?
Q. Why is WordNet missing: of, an, the, and, about, above, because, etc.
A. WordNet only contains "open-class words": nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Thus, excluded words include determiners, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, and particles.
